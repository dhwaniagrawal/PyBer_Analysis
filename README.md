# Matplotlib Module 5 Challenge #
## Overview of the Analysis ##
The overview of the analysis is to summarize how the ride sharing data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. This can be done by using Pandas and Matplotlib, by creating graphs, summary Data Frame of the ride-sharing data by city type.

## Results ##
1.In summary DataFrame, Eventhough Rural has the least number of total drivers and rides. They still have the highest Average fare per Driver.

## Summary ##
1. In Multiline-line chart data to truly compare the data the comparison parameters should be same. Here the comparison parameter is dates. The data recorded should be of the same dates of the each month.
2. There are NaN values in the data, which we ignored, this reduced the dataset.
